### Projects
#### Community Engagement Analysis
As a community manager for a WhatsApp community, I provide the group with a monthly analytics report that summarizes engagement and activities. This report helps track each member's engagement levels and supports data-driven decisions for members whose engagement falls below a set threshold. This project highlights my ability to handle large amounts of data while demonstrating my skills in setting clear objectives, asking the right questions, collecting and cleaning data, transforming and modeling it, analyzing the results, and presenting actionable insights to the community stakeholders.

#### Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis
A large supermarket experiencing a decline in sales contacted me as a data analyst to investigate their customer purchase data and understand purchasing behaviors. The project focused on applying marketing analytics, particularly customer segmentation, to group customers based on their buying patterns into about 10 segments. Targeted marketing campaigns were then designed for each segment. The segmentation method used was RFM analysis, which categorizes customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. This project emphasized data storytelling through visuals to effectively communicate the behavior and characteristics of each customer segment.

#### Optimizing Revenue for a Taxi Company
A startup ride-hailing taxi organization wanted to better understand their customers after three months of operations. Their goal was to use data analytics to drive revenue growth by analyzing taxi operations, customer behavior, and driver performance. The analysis focused on identifying trends and patterns across the 3-month period, segmenting customers using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary), and evaluating driver contributions to revenue. This project leveraged data storytelling with visuals to provide actionable insights, enabling the organization to make informed decisions that drive revenue growth.

#### Opay Wrapped - My 2024 Bank Transactions
I started actively using Opay during the cash scarcity in 2023, even though my account dates back to 2018. This project is uniquely personal as I play multiple roles: the analyst, the stakeholder, and the one with domain knowledge. Itâ€™s relatable, insightful, and fun. My aim is to understand how money flows in and out of my Opay account during 2024. I analysed the trend of both the debit and credit transactions across months in the year

#### Optimizing Sales and Marketing Strategies for a Pharmaceutical Company
Forggith Pharmaceuticals, a German pharmaceutical manufacturing company, engaged me to develop Power BI reports to support their sales and marketing strategies. The process involved defining clear objectives, understanding and preparing the dataset, modeling data relationships, analyzing and visualizing key performance metrics, and deploying the final reports. These reports provided insights at both granular levels (such as sales representatives) and executive levels, enabling the sales and marketing teams to track performance and make strategic, data-driven decisions effectively.
